# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Networks

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay with a service, using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow**. Achieved an accuracy of **79%**.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical features
   - Performed feature scaling

2. **Model Building**
   - Constructed a basic ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Used Dense layers with ReLU and Sigmoid activation
   - Compiled with binary cross-entropy loss

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained the ANN on historical customer data
   - Tuned for better accuracy

4. **Evaluation**
   - Achieved **79% accuracy**
   - Printed **confusion matrix** and **classification report** (precision, recall, f1-score)
